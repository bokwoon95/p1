TODO: properly pulling in all templates requires a double breadth-first-search loop...
do (populate templates) while (len(templates) > 0) 
# anytime a html template is invoked, check it exists but only add it to the template list if it hasn't been added before.
# if it doesn't exist, append the template->calls->template pair into a slice.
    do (populate nodes) while (len(nodes) > 0)
don't bail on first error, if a template is missing just note it down in a slice and return that slice to the user (as human readable error) at the end.

TODO: allow templates in pm-template to be .md files as well (so whenever you pull in a template you need to convert the template into a markdowned template. I think a function like Markdownify(*template.Template) (*template.Template, error) is in order.

TODO: implement pm-site override.

TODO: extract langcode from r.Path.

use regex to grab all the blocks i.e.
    {{ block "" . }}{{ end }}
or
    {{ block "" . }}
    {{ end }}
Blocks can be overridden by the user using ProseMirror. If there is a newline at the end of the block, it is using a textarea. Else, it uses a simple text field.

Blocks names with capital letters are considered to be global blocks (site-wide).
{{ block "SITE_NAME" . }}{{ end }}
vs
{{ block "about-me" . }}{{ end }}
