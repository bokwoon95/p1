use regex to grab all the blocks i.e.
    {{ block "" . }}{{ end }}
or
    {{ block "" . }}
    {{ end }}
Blocks can be overridden by the user using ProseMirror. If there is a newline at the end of the block, it is using a textarea. Else, it uses a simple text field.

Blocks names with capital letters are considered to be global blocks (site-wide).
{{ block "SITE_NAME" . }}{{ end }}
vs
{{ block "about-me" . }}{{ end }}
